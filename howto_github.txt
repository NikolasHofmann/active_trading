###### make new repo


# Create a Repo on GitHub ex. "trading-bot" (in your browser)



cd /path/to/your/project

git init

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit"

# link remote to repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trading-bot.git

# verify remote is set up
git remote -v

# check which branch you are on
git branch

# check the branches on the remote (if set up)
git branch -r

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# push
git push -u origin main


######  If you made changes locally and want to update your GitHub repo:

git remote show origin          # show which one is the HEAD branch, thats where we push to
git branch			# check which branch we are on
git checkout main		# if neccessary swap to the head branch, main in this case
git status                      # See what changed
git add .                       # Stage all changes
git commit -m "added howto_github"   # Commit the changes
git push origin main           # Push to GitHub (or replace 'main' with your branch name)


###### If you made a mistake and want to go back to the version on GitHub:

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
